	<h1>George Ng </h1>
	<h3>Front-End Web Developer</h3>

	<p id="aboutMeStart">Greetings! Iâ€™m currently a junior at UW Seattle and a 1st year Informatics major. </p>

	<p class="aboutMe">Right now, I'm on a hybrid degree path that consists of a mixture of Web Development and Cybersecurity.  </p>

	<p class="aboutMe">Ultimately, I think my greatest strengths lay in <b>Data Visualization and UI Development</b> as well as soft skills including <b>Adaptability, Leadership, and Communication. </b>
	</p>

	<p class="aboutMe">I love to learn and have a broad grasp of various technical topics with a particular focus on Frontend Web Development. However, I am also working on expanding my breadth of knowledge and learning Back-End skills as well (LAMP Stack, Azure). My hobbies include video games (Rainbow Six Siege is my go-to at the moment), Sci-Fi/Fantasy Novels (I recently picked up "The Expanse" series and haven't been able to put it down), and lots of cooking! </p>
