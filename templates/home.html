	<h1>George Ng </h1>
	<h3>Web Developer</h3>

	<p id="aboutMeStart">Greetings! Iâ€™m a Full Stack Web Developer and a Senior Informatics Major at UW Seattle. </p>

	<p class="aboutMe">I am comfortable in both the Front End and Back End, as well as have soft skills including <b>Adaptability, Leadership, and Communication</b> (my friends and colleagues often tell me that I'd make a great project manager as well). I also have a knack for Data Visualization and making tools that are both beautiful and easy to use (as a result of working in many teams without UI/UX members, and also something I think too many Engineers overlook).
	</p>

	<p class="aboutMe">I love to learn and have a broad grasp of various technical topics with a particular focus on Web Development. My favorite framework is Laravel (it just makes life so much easier in PHP) and my favorite library is LeafletJS (I really enjoy building map tools!). My hobbies include video games (VR is incredible and I'm a huge DOTA fan), Sci-Fi/Fantasy Novels (Game of Thrones is better in its novel form), and lots of cooking! </p>
