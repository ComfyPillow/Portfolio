	<h1>George Ng </h1>
	<h3>Web Developer</h3>

	<p id="aboutMeStart">Greetings! Iâ€™m currently a junior at UW Seattle and a 1st year Informatics major. </p>

	<p class="aboutMe">Right now, I'm on a hybrid degree path that consists of a mixture of Web Development and Software Engineering.  </p>

	<p class="aboutMe">Ultimately, I think my greatest strengths lay in the <b>Front-End</b> as well as soft skills including <b>Adaptability, Leadership, and Communication. </b>
	</p>

	<p class="aboutMe">I love to learn and have a broad grasp of various technical topics with a particular focus on Web Development. Currently, I am  working on expanding my breadth of knowledge and improving my Back-End skills (using the LAMP Stack and Azure). My hobbies include video games (VR is incredible and I'm a huge DOTA fan), Sci-Fi/Fantasy Novels (Game of Thrones is better in its novel form), and lots of cooking! </p>
